The song traces Barbie's mental journey of finding her own identity while illustrating the universal quest for purpose. It challenges the norms associated with pop music and redefines femininity within contemporary pop culture through minimalist production, soft vocal delivery, and lyrics that explore identity and vulnerability. Billie Eilish confronts the polished and lavish aesthetics typically expected in pop music as well as the physically idealized and emotionally excessive image of women. The song also reflects Billie Eilish’s personal experience, especially in her lyrics and music video (MV), making it emotionally accessible to listeners. By portraying this shared human experience, she creates a space for vulnerability, introspection, and healing. This project explores these ideas and speaks to Gen Z through several components of the project, including a song analysis, source-based essay, curated playlist, and commentary piece.</p><p>The gentle piano and soft humming throughout the song create a melancholic yet healing atmosphere, reflecting the emotional complexity of seeking identity but attempting to reduce peoples fear in facing this uncertainty. Created for the <em>Barbie</em> movie, the song gained popularity due to how effectively it captures both the film’s themes and listeners' emotional vulnerabilities. With the movie, the song centers on Barbie breaking perfect feminine stereotypes to find her purpose, but it also transcends its cinematic context by touching upon feminist ideas and expressing universal reflections on existence (Gerwig 2023). Billie Eilish parallels this journey with her own story through both lyrics and visuals in the MV she released along with the audio (Apple Music 2023). In this fast-paced world, people often feel anxious and ashamed when they find themselves not reaching societal expectations. However, the song responds to this pressure by creating a space for honesty and introspection. This theme is in the heart of the project’s curated playlist as well, accompanying “What Was I Made For?” The playlist includes songs that echo themes of excavating more about identity and finding self-worth, specifically describing the process of self-discovery and finding purpose. The playlist, along with the essay “Searching for Purpose: Identity and Healing in Billie Eilish’s ‘What Was I Made For?’” portrays and normalizes uncertainty and self-discovery as a shared experience.</p><p>The song’s meaning deepens when examined through Jessica A. Holmes’s analysis in “Billie Eilish and the Feminist Aesthetics of Depression.” Holmes explores how Billie Eilish emphasizes mental health, identity, and vulnerability along with her consistent use of whisper singing, often described as a type of ASMR that serves as a kind of therapy for Gen Z (Holmes 2023, 821). She notes how Billie Eilish’s music resonates firmly with the current generation. Uniquely, Holmes depicts Billie Eilish as someone who deliberately rejects mainstream pop’s expectations for female artists to perform emotional excess or dramatized hysteria (Eloise 2020). Instead, Billie Eilish embraces quiet introspection and subtle emotional authenticity. This resistance extends to her fashion choices and public image. As explored in “Quiet Resistance: Billie Eilish’s Minimalist Resistance in Pop Music,” her oversized clothing and subdued presence in events and music videos oppose the hyper-feminine aesthetic that is often expected, rejecting the narrow definitions of women and femininity. Musically, the minimalist style of her music and her use of a whispering voice reject the heavily produced trending style in pop music. Billie Eilish's rejection of these conventions becomes part of her narrative in “What Was I Made For?”, reinforcing that femininity and self-worth do not need to be perfect and loud. These are explored more closely in “ASMR, Depression, and Resistance: Reading Billie Eilish with Jessica Holmes” and “Quiet Resistance: Billie Eilish’s Minimalist Resistance in Pop Music.”</p><p>Together, the project components portray “What Was I Made For?” as a song that gently expresses vulnerability while firmly rejecting cultural pressure. “Searching for Purpose: Identity and Healing in Billie Eilish’s ‘What Was I Made For?’” emphasizes how Billie Eilish uses sound, text, and visuals to communicate and create a safe space, while the playlist reflects the identity-searching process, explicitly demonstrating this shared experience. “ASMR, Depression, and Resistance: Reading Billie Eilish with Jessica Holmes” explores a scholar’s framework of Billie Eilish’s music style and ideology, introducing her music and attitude as a form of rejection. “Quiet Resistance: Billie Eilish’s Minimalist Resistance in Pop Music” further extends this by contrasting Billie Eilish’s music with mainstream pop music and her style with prevalent beauty standards. While Billie Eilish uses her minimalist sound, visuals, and lyrics to resonate with people due to how she makes room for discomfort and validates vulnerability, she also challenges the norms of femininity, emotional expression, and pop culture. Her music is beyond a soundtrack of a movie and a personal reflection, it is an embodiment of how pop/alternative pop can create space for meaningful expressions of identity and vulnerability.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Bibliography</strong></p><p>Apple Music. 2023. “Billie Eilish: “What Was I Made For?”, Barbie &amp; Songwriting | Apple Music”.<em>Youtube</em>, July 13.
