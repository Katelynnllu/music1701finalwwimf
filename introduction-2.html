As part of the original soundtrack, the song traces Barbie's mental journey of finding her own identity while illustrating the universal quest for purpose. This project analyzes different aspects of the song. Each component of this project explores a unique dimension, from its musical composition and lyrical vulnerability to its feminist critique and cultural resonance, to collectively argue that Billie Eilish’s soft but powerful music redefines femininity, identity, and emotional expression within contemporary pop culture. With the song’s minimal production, the song’s central theme of mental health and identity, and the artist’s use of soft vocals, this production challenges the norms associated with pop music, where it is often presented to be loud and lavish. In a broader view, this song and Billie Eilish’s music challenge conventional pop culture and highlight women identity and struggles. Besides speaking of a broader message, Billie Eilish’s music, especially lyrics and music video, also reflects her experience and struggles. By openly portraying this shared human experience, she creates a space for vulnerability, introspection, and healing. Billie Eilish’s music is both an artistic expression and an expression of universal struggle that promotes discussion about femininity, mental health and self-worth. It is also a cultural statement actively challenging the bounds of pop culture. It is where she provides her special “Billie Eilish” therapy.</p><p>The gentle piano and soft humming throughout the song create a melancholic yet healing atmosphere, reflecting the complexities of seeking identity and inner peace. Created for the <em>Barbie</em> movie, the song gained popularity due to how effectively it captures both the film’s themes and listeners' emotional vulnerabilities. With the movie, the song centers on Barbie breaking perfect feminine stereotypes to find her purpose, but also transcending its cinematic context by touching upon feminist ideas and expressing universal reflections on existence (Gerwig 2023). Eilish parallels this journey with her own story through both lyrical choices and visual choices in the MV she released along with the audio. In a world that moves at a fast pace, where many follow the mainstream, it can feel difficult to reflect on oneself. People often feel guilty for not meeting social expectations of perfection and embarrassed when uncertain about their purpose.<strong> </strong>Yet, these experiences are fundamentally human. This song provides a space for healing and reflection, encompassing many parts of a personal journey, as illustrated in a playlist stemming from "What Was I Made For?". Like the song, the playlist attempts to remind a generation burdened by social expectations that such uncertainties are normal. “Searching for Purpose: Identity and Healing in Billie Eilish’s ‘What Was I Made For?’” discusses how Billie Eilish metaphorically parallels her own experience with the narrative of the Barbie movie to communicate a universal struggle about identity and self-discovery and provide a safe space.</p><p>The song’s meaning deepens when examined through Jessica A. Holmes’s analysis in “Billie Eilish and the Feminist Aesthetics of Depression”. Holmes explores how Eilish's focus on mental health, identity, and vulnerability along with her continuous emphasize on her whisper singing that is often considered as a type of ASMR serves as a type of therapy for the current generation (Holmes 2023, 821). She notes how Billie Eilish’s music resonates strongly with Gen Z. More uniquely, Holmes depicts Billie Eilish as someone who deliberately rejects traditional views of emotional expression in pop music and how women tend to express emotions through hysteria. These traditional views frequently demand exaggerated or dramatic performances from female artists (Eloise 2020). Instead, Eilish embraces quiet introspection and subtle emotional authenticity. Her fashion choices also speak this way. As explored in the blog post, her oversized clothing and presentation in events and music videos oppose the hyper-feminine aesthetic that is often expected, rejecting the narrow definitions of women and femininity. Regarding music, the relatively minimal style of her music and her use of whispering voice, which connects to other components of the project, reject the trending style in pop music. Taken together, her rejection of these conventions becomes part of her narrative in “What Was I Made For?”, reinforcing that femininity and self-worth do not need to be perfect and loud. These are explored more closely in “ASMR, Depression, and Resistance: Reading Billie Eilish with Jessica Holmes” and “Quiet Resistance: Billie Eilish’s Minimalist Resistance in Pop Music”.</p><p>These elements build a portrait of “What Was I Made For?” as a song that softly speaks out people’s vulnerability and rejects cultural pressure. The “Searching for Purpose: Identity and Healing in Billie Eilish’s ‘What Was I Made For?’” emphasizes how Billie Eilish uses sound, text, and visuals to communicate and create a safe space, while “ASMR, Depression, and Resistance: Reading Billie Eilish with Jessica Holmes” explores a scholar’s framework of Billie Eilish’s music style and ideology. The playlist then carefully illustrates the process of finding one’s identity and value, which is presented both in the movie and in the song. The blog post further extends this by contrasting Billie Eilish’s music with mainstream pop music and her style with prevalent beauty standards. Billie Eilish creates music that creates space for uncomfortable feelings, telling a story of searching, exploring, and resisting through the song “What Was I Made For?”. She not only reflects a movie, or herself, but creates room for all listeners to confront their uncertainties about identity and purpose. Her work has come to represent a form of quiet resistance that resonates with universal experiences in this era.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Bibliography</strong></p><p>Holmes, Jessica A. 2023. “Billie Eilish and the Feminist Aesthetics of Depression: White Femininity, Generation Z, and Whisper Singing.” <em>Journal of the American Musicological Society</em> 76 (3): 785–829. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1525/jams.2023.76.3.785">https://doi.org/10.1525/jams.2023.76.3.785</a>.</p><p>Eloise, Marianne. 2020.
