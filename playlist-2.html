You hear the first note of the melody and the first humming whispered by Billie Eilish. A calm, weightless voice but carrying an immense feeling of uncertainty and doubt, a question of “What Was I Made For?”, and a silent ache. This song illustrates the struggle of discovering one’s purpose and identity. Perhaps you’ve felt it too. Sometimes, when you look through the mirror and notice a small imperfection of yours that does not align with society’s expectations and the majority’s preference. It could be a pimple, a stretch mark, the softness of your inner thighs, or a bad mood. You might feel like you are falling short of the expectations that are not necessarily correct and start to question yourself. But are you made to fulfill these expectations? Maybe we should put down the burden society imposes on us, identify what we truly want, and embrace who we are. Let the music sink in. Listen to how each piece of music unravels identity and self-worth and, maybe, follow Barbie’s path. We should never forget that we are not meant to be perfect. Our value is ours to discover but not something others define for us. The playlist follows an emotional journey, inviting us to examine our own identity and get a more honest understanding of ourselves. Press the next song button and let the music carry you.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/media/posts/12/elisa-photography-tVEMwaR9XqI-unsplash.jpg" alt="An image of a girl looking in the mirror.

You feel a sense of “Motion Sickness”. As the beat of the prelude goes on, you hear your own heartbeat. It is nervous and unsure, like the floating melody played by the instrument in the accompaniment. Along with the dull tone and hazy voice of Phoebe Bridgers, you feel a little dizzy and disoriented, like your mind is being pulled in different directions. "I have emotional motion sickness […], I could scream to drown you out." Bridger voices the feeling of being pulled in different directions in an unhealthy relationship and being shaped by the other person in her relationship, just like how Billie Eilish and Barbie also experience such feeling of being shaped by others. This emotional turmoil mirrors Billie Eilish’s struggles with fame and the cracks in the perfect figure Barbie has always embodied. As the ending note of “Motion Sickness” slowly fades, a sense of unease stays, and a blurry view remains.</p><p>At this moment, you can still feel the distinct pulse of your heart, and the upbeat tempo of “Anti-hero” comes in. In contrast with this beat is the heavy message that the lyrics tell. Intrusive thoughts come in with Taylor Swift’s narrative. “It’s me hi I’m the problem it’s me […]. I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror.” These haunting words are someone’s painfully honest reflection of one’s role. A strong internal doubt fills your heart, clearer than before. You notice a question about self-worth emerging, and you try to make sense of it. This echoes Billie Eilish’s doubt of her value and Barbie’s questioning of her identity. As the song draws to a close, the self-doubt and self-criticism continue to linger in the silence.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/media/posts/12/carolina-ghYHNrzS8pk-unsplash.jpg" alt="An image of a lonely and sad girl. This represents the feeling of uncertainty and struggle at the start of the journey, noticing that she is not fully sure of her value and identity." width="4702" height="3456" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/media/posts/12/responsive/carolina-ghYHNrzS8pk-unsplash-xs.jpg 640w, https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/media/posts/12/responsive/carolina-ghYHNrzS8pk-unsplash-sm.jpg 768w, https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/media/posts/12/responsive/carolina-ghYHNrzS8pk-unsplash-md.jpg 1024w, https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/media/posts/12/responsive/carolina-ghYHNrzS8pk-unsplash-lg.jpg 1366w, https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/media/posts/12/responsive/carolina-ghYHNrzS8pk-unsplash-xl.jpg 1600w, https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/media/posts/12/responsive/carolina-ghYHNrzS8pk-unsplash-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><p>You close your eyes, feeling a gentle piano melody slipping in your ear, immersed in a feeling of nostalgic melancholy. Taylor Swift’s voice enters again, aligning well with the rhythmic instrumental background that has a taste of folk music. A retrospective, nostalgic atmosphere is created, like flipping through a, reflecting on past experiences. You recall many of your past moments, reflecting on your actions and motivations. This scene coincides with the scene where Billie Eilish reflects on her past journey in the music video of “What Was I Made For”, sorting her miniature. “All Too Well?” Maybe not always. While Taylor Swift gradually reveals her story of heartbreak and slowly rebuilding her sense of worth, Billie Eilish and Barbie embark on their own journeys of self-discovery. The song then ends in a soft, decaying voice, leaving a trail of unknown and infinite possibilities.</p><p>Don’t forget. This journey might not be that easy, because there are always “People Watching”. Surrounded by lively instrumental music and the powerful voice of Sam Fender with a sense of momentum, you don’t feel that alone anymore. In the sense of not being alone, it does mean that you are being watched and pressured by other people, but it also means that you are not struggling alone. The doubts do not only occur to you but to others as well. The uncertainty you feel is not only about sadness and pain but your desire to understand yourself and engage with the world more meaningfully. This illustrates what Billie Eilish feels as an artist and what Barbie feels like as this ideal figure. However, they carry an energy with them, forging their way into the real world, embracing and revealing their true selves. I hope this nervous excitement also replenishes and excites you on your journey.</p><p>Maybe you feel the pressure under people’s gaze, under a “Spotlight” you never asked for, under a perfect standard no one could exactly cope with. The quiet breakdown, the uncertainty—it’s all understandable in different ways. Cai Xukun’s soulful voice and the guitar accompaniment tell his story of being trapped in the spotlight, but ultimately making his way of living without being defined by the “audience of your life”. “I’ve been through the dark, and even there’s a light. So I keep holdin’ on.” Do not give up on breaking free from the gaze that confines you and diminishes you. Like Barbie, who steps into the harsh reality and accepts it, or Billie Eilish, who finds a way to live up to her own standards and express herself. The shimmering guitar creates a sense of space and distance, but also brings a light, energizing power. It is not a harsh spotlight, but a soft, guiding light. The echoes of Cai Xukun’s still remain so does the shimmering guitar.</p><p>Quiet for an intense, dynamic piece of music enters the scene. You hear a drum kicking in hard, a heavy bass, and Sia’s thick, assertive vocals. The music builds up to an especially passionate and strong chorus that explodes with the lines “Well I’ve got a thick skin and an elastic heart […] You won’t see me move no more.” Your heartbeat rises again, and though grappling with feelings of being lost, you are more certain than ever that you are ready to embrace yourself even if it means accepting imperfections. You know you have an “Elastic Heart”, and so do Billie Eilish and Barbie. Barbie learns about imperfections in the real world and grows to find meaning beyond people’s image of her. Billie Eilish shifts toward a more determined phase. When you look in the mirror, you see not only those that make you insecure, but those that make you proud- your shining pupils, your muscles, your strength, etc. The driving beat seems endless, unstoppable. You know, it is just like your determination and energy.</p><p>Without taking much of a breath, you are hit by Jennie’s bold and assertive voice. “Kick it”, you think, “I am letting it all out.” You hide no more and hesitate no more. While it might be the process of healing before, this piece feels like empowerment and self-assurance. BLACKPINK sings to you as you find your self-worth and your definition of yourself. It is the stage where Barbie takes ownership of herself rather than her surroundings and where Billie Eilish becomes who she wants to be. Though the ending of 'What Was I Made For?' remains ambiguous, your resolution is better and more defined.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/media/posts/12/yukon-haughton-VXRXiKQ5_-8-unsplash.jpg" alt="An image of Billie Eilish's eye, which is a very determined look.

After going through different stages of perplexity, doubt, and then finding a way, resilience, and finally reassurance, you may find that the journey of self-discovery is not just linear, but full of complexities and emotions. Like how the songs navigate us, how Barbie finds the position for the imperfect her in her world and the real world, and how Billie Eilish creates her own path in fame, you know that perfection is not real. The point should be being the real and who you want to be. Do not fear, follow the tracks even though they are not that defined. It is the way forward.</p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/">Back to Homepage</a></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/overview.html">Overview Page</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/introduction-2.html" class="al" target="_self">Introduction</a></li><li><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/critical-reading-2.html" class="al" target="_self">ASMR, Depression, and Resistance: Reading Billie Eilish with Jessica Holmes</a></li><li><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/music-review-2.html" class="al" target="_self">Searching for Purpose: Identity and Healing in Billie Eilish’s &quot;What Was I Made For?&quot;</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/playlist-2.html" class="al" target="_self">Through the Music: A Playlist for Finding Yourself</a></li><li><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/final-essay-2.html" class="al" target="_self">Quiet Resistance: Billie Eilish’s Minimalist Resistance in Pop Music</a></li><li><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/bibliography-2.html" class="al" target="_self">Bibliography</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
