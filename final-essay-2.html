Many current prevalent pop artists set these standards, like Ariana Grande, Katy Perry, Selena Gomez, and so on. Thinking of the modern definition of beauty and female artists, people would have an image of the words thin, pale, dainty, and airbrushed. These are also usually influenced by public figures. However, Billie Eilish’s visual representation in the industry contests this common expectation. While Billie Eilish disrupts the formula of mainstream pop music with her whisper singing and minimalist style, she also challenges the societal expectations placed upon young female artists.</p><p>The original soundtrack of the “Barbie” movie, showcases Billie Eilish’s signature whisper singing. Her signature singing has a contrast with the style of mainstream pop. As discussed in a journal article from <em>Popular Music</em>, critics state that “mainstream pop songs are potentially the epitome of catchiness and simplicity – ‘the most popular blend of different types of catchy, easy-on-the-ears, literally popular music’. They also carry the image of being polished, pre-processed, cut-and-dried, overproduced, and removed from any edge whatsoever (Steinbrecher 2022, 409). However, in this song, with a soft, reflective, and soothing voice, Billie Eilish voices out the common concern about identity and existential. Without the need for impressive high notes and crescendos in vocals that tend to overpower the listeners and overwhelm them in the beats and melody, Billie Eilish employs consistent quiet vocals that invite reflection and connection. Also, unlike mainstream pop music which always presents themselves to be confident, commanding, and unshakeable, Billie Eilish shows a rare side of human vulnerability, reminding people that having concerns and being uncertain is normal and is a shared experience. She creates a space for healing while mainstream pop music is more likely to provide a place for entertainment and escapism, often prioritizing catchy melodies and lines over emotional introspection and vulnerability. As discussed in a journal article in the Journal of American Musicological Society, “Billie Eilish allows for and affirms a plurality of experiences without dictating a single outlook” (Holmes 2023, 800). Unlike many of the chart-topping hits, which heavily depend on electronic beats, excessive instruments, and technologically enhanced vocals, Billie Eilish’s song stand straightforward. Without polished production, this song only includes a few instruments, harmony, and a single scene for the music video. With this setting, it highlights the lyrics that are sung in an ethereal voice, highlighting the authenticity and rawness of the emotions in the lyrics. By choosing a minimal production style, Billie Eilish delivers a powerful message through music without the need for complicated arrangements and technology but through emotional sincerity and storytelling lyrics through a narrative and genuine voice. This type of minimalistic style extends beyond the song “What Was I Made For?”, being an essential part of Billie Eilish’s music works. Almost every other song she produces holds this minimalist style——minimalist aesthetic, simple accompaniment, soft vocals—— and her whispering voice.</p><p>Beyond just challenging pop music through her voice, she also challenges expectations regarding young females. There is usually a perception that teenage girls tend to be overly moody and express distress and feelings through hysteria (Holmes 2023, 802), yet Billie Eilish’s intentionally quiet expression of stress and uncertainties is a contest to this stereotype. It is also against the culture that demands women to shout and be loud to be noticed. Billie Eilish rejects the need for this, using her soft vocal delivery to push back against stereotypes and counter the need for extra effort for women to stand out. Simultaneously, her distinctive style of dressing is another form of resistance against mainstream expectations of women. She is often known for her oversized, baggy dressing style, wearing what she wants without being subjected to societal expectations and scrutiny (Elizabeth 2020). Concealing her body shape and not wearing those that are expected from men in society, she challenges unrealistic beauty standards and faces the societal pressures exerted on women, especially about their attire and style. This approach of hers makes her someone who challenges and redefines the meaning of feminine, going against conventional norms and views on women's bodies. Through both her work and her appearance, she tries to contest past boundaries and advocate for greater diversity for women.</p><p>In a consistent pattern, Billie Eilish implements this minimalist style in her music works and outfit style that follows what she wants. In “What Was I Made For?”, Billie Eilish continues her quiet rebellion against mainstream pop music and societal expectations for women through her minimalist approach to music, her unique whispering singing, and her consistent dressing style. She presents more than a stylistic choice, but an act that challenges cultural norms.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Bibliography</strong></p><p>Holmes, Jessica A. 2023. “Billie Eilish and the Feminist Aesthetics of Depression: White</p><p>Femininity, Generation Z, and Whisper Singing.” <em>Journal of the American Musicological Society</em> 76 (3): 785–829. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1525/jams.2023.76.3.785">https://doi.org/10.1525/jams.2023.76.3.785</a>.</p><p>Eilish, Billie. 2023. “Billie Eilish - What Was I Made For?
