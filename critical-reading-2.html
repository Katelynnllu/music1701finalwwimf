Holmes discusses how Billie Eilish’s songs and public image present a unique message of depression and consistently challenge the conventional portrayal of femininity. Holmes explores both the potential problems and merits of Billie Eilish’s explicitness in articulating mental health-related issues, ultimately landing on the conclusion that Billie Eilish’s work that embraces depression is creative and transformative because of how it also rejects earlier stereotypes about feminine expressions in pop, like hysteria (Holmes 2023, 822). While focusing on depression, Holmes also examines Billie Eilish’s whisper singing in relation to ASMR, which is often considered a form of meditation and therapy (Holmes 2023, 821). Billie Eilish’s work is thus widely accepted and praised by young, Gen Z audiences. </p><p>Holmes employs significant qualitative analysis when discussing specific examples of lyrics and vocalizations in Billie Eilish’s songs, public reactions to her music, and the background context of depression, feminine stereotypes, and ASMR. When discussing the lyrics and how Billie Eilish presents her music, Holmes refers to several songs and their corresponding music videos, including “When the Party’s Over,” “Your Power,” “Male Fantasy,” “Bury a Friend,” and “Not My Responsibility.” Holmes also specifically talks about how Billie Eilish presents her voice in these songs by dissecting how she processes each line of lyrics and finally presents it. To illustrate the reactions from the world, Holmes refers to many posts and comments from social media sources, like Reddit, and certain websites, to include a variety of critiques from other audiences. When discussing the background and social context, the author cites many renowned news sources, several scholarly sources, and musical journalism to define the vocabulary she is using and what is happening in modern society. With all these sources laid out, Holmes analyzes Billie Eilish’s vocal techniques, lyrical themes, and visual aesthetics, contextualizing them into the greater social and cultural context. She provides a comprehensive review of Billie Eilish’s music, incorporating perspectives from both those who idolize her and those who question and doubt her music. Since this source mainly focuses on qualitative aspects like the music itself and its broader contextual meaning, Holmes does not incorporate much quantitative analysis. While presenting all the evidence she has and having a clear point of view, Holmes positions herself as someone who synthesizes all these sources and who provides her analysis and point of view.</p><p>This journal article is structured into a few key ideas, including gender and depression (or mental health) in pop music, cultural and racial influences, vocal characteristics, and ASMR. Holmes starts with the idea of depression and how Billie Eilish incorporates this, usually evoking emotions of sadness and melancholy in her works. While doing so, Holmes presents a bipolar response from the surrounding as some listener’s concern that her music could contribute to more depression while other listeners find comfort because of the empathy they can find in the experience Billie Eilish is describing (Holmes 2023, 801). She connects depression with Billie Eilish’s personal experiences with her illness and whiteness (Holmes 2023, 799). She then draws a connection to the greater racial problem in mental health, touching upon several misconceptions that people have and current societal problems, signifying the need of more music like this (Holmes 2023, 798). Moving on, Holmes interprets Billie Eilish’s unique singing technique and its relatedness to ASMR, suggesting how her voice and works facilitate healing as well (Holmes 2023, 821). This journal article presents an intersection of pop culture, mental health, and gender studies. It is significant as Holmes points out how music like Billie Eilish’s music creatively utilizes sounds, visual aesthetics, and social media to articulate and personify depression and the experience of going through such hardship to her fans and those who are also going through the same difficult phase. She points out that music is a new form of public health discourse. Also, by arguing this, the author dissects what has made Billie Eilish’s fame, her uniqueness, creativity, and boldness in presenting her ideas and insisting on her beliefs. At the same time, the author identifies several issues regarding gender and race in discussions of depression and the music industry, suggesting potential progress in these areas.</p><p>This article provides a very comprehensive and nuanced analysis of Billie Eilish’s music in multiple disciplines and includes multiple points of view. However, while the article includes many critical perspectives, Holmes does not fully address them in a way that convincingly supports her final interpretation of Billie Eilish’s music as having an overall positive effect. Also, the place where she includes the social context and in-depth scholarly studies sometimes makes its readers lost and stray to something outside of the main point of the article. Finally, the article might benefit from more quantitative data to support more of her points, for instance, how many people listen, how many people like the criticizing posts of her music, etc. This source can help build a strong foundation and understanding of Billie Eilish’s style of music in general, her past struggles with mental health, and her position in the pop music industry, which would help analyze the theme and social implications of further songs that she produces since themes of depression and vulnerability are central for many of her songs. Additionally, Holmes’s framework on visuals and sound can help analyze whether Billie Eilish will continue to use these elements in future songs like “What Was I Made For?”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Bibliography</strong></p><p>Holmes, Jessica A. 2023. “Billie Eilish and the Feminist Aesthetics of Depression: White Femininity, Generation Z, and Whisper Singing.” <em>Journal of the American Musicological Society</em> 76 (3): 785–829. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1525/jams.2023.76.3.785">https://doi.org/10.1525/jams.2023.76.3.785</a></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/music-review-2.html">Back to Music Review of the Song</a></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/overview.html">Overview Page</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/introduction-2.html" class="al" target="_self">Introduction</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/critical-reading-2.html" class="al" target="_self">ASMR, Depression, and Resistance: Reading Billie Eilish with Jessica Holmes</a></li><li><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/music-review-2.html" class="al" target="_self">Searching for Purpose: Identity and Healing in Billie Eilish’s &quot;What Was I Made For?&quot;</a></li><li><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/playlist-2.html" class="al" target="_self">Through the Music: A Playlist for Finding Yourself</a></li><li><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/final-essay-2.html" class="al" target="_self">Quiet Resistance: Billie Eilish’s Minimalist Resistance in Pop Music</a></li><li><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/bibliography-2.html" class="al" target="_self">Bibliography</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
