Released on July 13, 2023, the official music video version of “What Was I Made For” narrates both her own experience and Barbie’s story. The music video is a one-shot video of Billie Eilish, who is dressed as a vintage Barbie, sorting her miniature outfits that she has worn in the past. She encounters a storm that prevents her from doing so throughout the process, but ultimately manages to go through the storm. This music video unfolds a metaphorical story describing the beautiful but also poignant journey of finding one’s purpose and identity. “What Was I Made For?” is the title of the song and also the core message of the song (lyrics), illustrating the feeling of being lost when finding one’s value and position in life. In “What Was I Made For (Official Music Video)”, Billie Eilish metaphorically paralleled her own experience with the narrative of the <em>Barbie</em> movie, effectively communicating a universal struggle about identity and self-discovery and providing a space for healing and reflection.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Lyrics About Identity and Purpose</strong></p><p>Through the lyrics, Billie Eilish highlights the universal experience of going through an identity crisis, drawing a clear link between her struggles and the narrative of Barbie. “I used to float. Now I just fall down.” This opening line of the song references the scene where Barbie slides down the slide of her pink Barbie house. This is when Barbie thinks everything is perfect, when she is living a “carefree” life (Lowe 2024). However, she later “falls down” and experiences vulnerable feelings like self-doubt and uncertainty, shifting her perspective from an idealized view to noticing her imperfections and the fundamental imperfection of humanity. This also reflects Billie Eilish’s early experience navigating fame, where she initially felt invincible and empowered but eventually questioned her own capabilities (Willman 2023). Starting with this lyric and transitioning into the repeated lyrics in the chorus line “What was I made for?”, the lyrics align with the themes of identity and self-doubt found in both Billie Eilish’s personal experiences and the <em>Barbie</em> movie. The beginning naturally leads to a question of “what is my purpose if I am not what I think I am?”, which is what the main chorus suggests. The repetition of the chorus line “What was I made for?” prompts a strong sense of introspection and self-discovery, presenting a strong desire to search for the purpose and value of life. While this narrative revolves around a female voice, it also does not overlook men’s perspective, as it includes the lyrics “I’m sad again. Don’t tell my boyfriend. It’s not what he’s made for.” The lyrics implicitly address the societal expectations on men——that they should be always masculine, strong, and the place for people to share their sadness and vulnerabilities. These lyrics also connects to the <em>Barbie</em> character Ken, who struggles to express his sadness and uncertainties, especially about his self-worth. Billie Eilish highlights the challenges societal expectations create for women while also acknowledging the stereotypes imposed on men. The song may not be heavily focused on creating diverse lines of lyrics, but the frequently appearing repetition underscores a theme of self-discovery, connecting to the recent increased focus on mental health and the generational quest for identity. Also, the lyrics of this song are particularly authentic as Billie Eilish says that the lyrics are exactly how she feels (Apple Music 2023, 22:28).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Motivation and Thoughts Behind Song Production and Music Video Production</strong></p><p>Through relatively simple musical arrangement and symbolic visuals in the music video, Billie Eilish uses her personal experiences and the distinctive qualities of her voice to illustrate the universal struggle with identity and self-worth. Though both the music arrangement in the soundtrack and the music video are relatively simple compared to other productions, they can arouse strong emotional feelings and empathy. For the soundtrack, Billie Eilish included subtle harmonies to her main voice, creating the feeling of a light echo directly whispering into someone’s ears. With her ethereal voice, the mixing and editing of these sounds make her music sound especially soothing, creating a therapeutic vibe like many of her other songs. For many of her past songs, critics have argued that “her voice and music function for Gen Z fans in the very same way as ASMR” (Warrenburg 2021, 140). Many of her fans also claim that her songs provide a special “Billie Eilish” therapy. This song has also received comments like this. As ASMR is often considered to serve as a type of therapy (<a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/critical-reading-2.html">Holmes 2023</a>, 821), Billie Eilish’s choice of preserving this singing style and producing authentic lyrics for “What Was I Made For” bring connections to more people and facilitate healing and deep reflection. Through the music video, where Billie Eilish sorts and hangs her miniature, each of which presenting a part of her identity, in a storm, she tries to visually symbolize the process of embracing and reconciling different parts of oneself. As Billie Eilish also dresses up like a Barbie, she links this both to her own career and the theme of Barbie. She reflects a core struggle for identity that is addressed through the song and movie. By employing metaphors and visualizations, Billie Eilish presents a narrative of her own experience and Barbie’s story while also creating a space that fosters introspection and healing.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Social and Cultural Influence</strong></p><p>Beyond telling the story of her own career path and Barbie’s story, Billie Eilish speaks to a broader audience and addresses widely shared concerns about identity and self-worth. “I want to dedicate to anyone who experiences hopelessness and the feeling of existential dread and feeling like, what’s the point and why am I here and why am I doing this for?” She said this as she received the Chairman’s award for “What Was I Made For” at the Film Awards Gala (Lowe 2024). With her music, she intends to create a space for discussing these topics, providing insights and facilitating the resolution of identity issues. Even though both the lyrics and the music video do not have a clear resolution, they still provide a strong illustration of the process of transformation and realization, shedding light on a possible path. As a whole, this recording that intertwines Billie Eilish’s personal experience with narratives of <em>Barbie</em> reflects not only reflects on contemporary problems and discussions regarding identity and self-worth, but creates a reflective therapeutic conversation with her listeners, discussing this topic openly and engaging with a broad audience.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Bibliography</strong></p><p>Apple Music. 2023. “Billie Eilish: “What Was I Made For?”, Barbie &amp; Songwriting | Apple Music”.</p><p><em>Youtube</em>, July 13.
