Along with the content and style of her songs, the article provides an analysis on her voice and its effect in presenting her message, facilitating health in those that might have encountered mental hardships and bringing empowerment to fans and listeners. The article analyzes many songs of Billie Eilish, like When the Party’s Over, Your Power, Male Fantasy, Bury a Friend, etc., including scenes from the music videos of these songs, and takes into account many other critic’s qualitative evaluations of her song. This source provides a good overview of the overall trend of Billie Eilish’s song and one of the main ideas she wants to represent, allowing one to build better foundations for understanding the content and meaning behind her later songs.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eloise, Marianne. 2020.

It discusses how they have built unique and distinctive images that do not follow the conventional feminine image, highlighting how they challenge past boundaries of women pop artists. This article pulled information from sources like interviews of Billie Eilish, Youtube videos, social media posts, and newspaper articles to show the experiences of Billie Eilish and Avril Lavigne, who shares a similar unconventional image, implicating how they are potentially influencing future generations of female pop artists. This source provides a great comparison between the two artists but could have given more depth analysis on their growth and the background context that have made them do so. This source discusses female identity and expectations, covering ideas that are relevant to the theme of the song “What Was I Made For?” and giving inspirations on the connection between the song and Billie Eilish’s past experience.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tsara, Elka and Susilastuti, Dewi H. 2024. “The Evolution of Public Reactions on Celebrity Grooming Relationships: An Analysis of Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift.” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journal of Translational American Studies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 11 (2): 229-250. doi: </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.22146/rubikon.v11i2.94434"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://doi.org/10.22146/rubikon.v11i2.94434</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Published in the Journal of Translational American Studies, this article focuses on the discussion of the grooming relationships of Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish in relation to public discourse and perception throughout the different stages of the Me Too movement. Utilizing ideas of feminist media theory, comparative analysis, and sources like digital magazines and social media commentary, the article points out the aspects that appear to be grooming in the two relationships and compares the two relationships under public perception. The author also analyzes the change in how the public responds to the two relationships after and before the Me Too movement. This source provides a distinctive perspective to Billie Eilish’s social life and one of her past experiences. Looking at this-her relationship- alongside with many of Billie Eilish’s interviews and songs, I can find reasonings in her lyrics and overall style. Her constant discussion of identity, relationships, and experience in navigating fame can be somehow inferred from this source due to her own experience in these fields. This also helps me to gain more understanding of the song lyrics of What Was I Made For, which is closely related to female identity and power.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gerwig, Greta, dir. 2023. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Warner Bros. Pictures. Video, 1 hr., 53 min. </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80157969?source=35"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.netflix.com/title/80157969?source=35</span></a></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This movie, released on July 21, 2023 and directed by Greta Gerwig, revolves around the main character Barbie and her journey of learning about the complexities of emotions and identity. While she first experienced existential crises, she ultimately was able to find her own purpose and identity beyond the stereotypical “perfect Barbie” as she accepted imperfection and humanity. Ken, who often lived as an attachment to Barbie and did not have a clear view of his own identity, also learned to embrace his individuality and live without other people’s affirmation. This source is one of the background contexts of the song What Was I Made For. Thus, by understanding the story and theme of this film, I can understand more about the meaning of the lyrics and its greater implications. Also, by looking at where the song was played in the movie and what role it played, I can also analyze its other aspects such as style, mood, etc.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kurmanbayeva, Zarina and Kassimova, Zulfiya. 2021. “Intermediality Problems in the Context of Study of Pop Vocal Performance.” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central Asian Journal of Art Studies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 6 (4): 91–103. doi: </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.47940/cajas.v6i4.457"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://doi.org/10.47940/cajas.v6i4.457</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Published in the Central Asian Journal of Art Studies, this article uses postmodernist philosophy, semiotics, and media studies to show that pop music is not just auditory but integrates visual, performative, and digital elements. The author argues that modern pop music reflects societal and technological progress through these integrations and advocates for including more interdisciplinary approaches in pop music to meet modern audience’s demand and engage in the digital era nowadays. This article can help me understand Billie Eilish’s various approaches to including more visual and digital elements in her music and the effects of those approaches. The song “What Was I Made For?” actively engages with aspects of visual performances, digital aspects, and the current film industry, exemplifying a way of integrating intermediality, helping me to understand why intermediality is essential to contemporary music and specifically for Billie Eilish’s piece.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor, Zariah. 2020. “We Need to Talk About Billie Eilish [Opinion].” VOXATL. February 7. </span><a href="https://voxatl.org/billie-eilish-cultural-appropriation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://voxatl.org/billie-eilish-cultural-appropriation/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article by Zariah Taylor, published on VOX ATL, discusses the concerns regarding Billie Eilish’s behavior of actively engaging in black culture but not fully acknowledging it and the phenomenon of how Billie Eilish and other white artists do not experience the same discrimination and standards as black artists. The author draws from Billie Eilish’s interview, her songs and implements observational analysis on Billie Eilish’s style and manners. The author notes that Billie Eilish wears hoops, baggy clothes, uses African American Vernacular English and "blaccent", but then criticizes black artists for fabricating narratives involving violence and sexual content while she also does the same. She actively engages with black culture but does not properly recognize it and does not experience the same discrimination. The author also goes beyond, discussing race in the industry as a whole, highlighting the different treatment of people of different races. While giving insights on how artists’ adoption on black cultural elements may be perceived and criticized by the public, this piece provides a supplementary perspective on Billie Eilish, specifically about self-perception, public-perception, and pressure regarding fame. It can be helpful when I draw a connection between her song and her own experience. Giving me more context about Billie Eilish and her music, this source also touches upon the potential sources that have influenced Billie Eilish’s music—— black culture. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Máthé, Nóra. 2024. “‘I'm Not Pretty Anymore:’Feminity and Beauty in the Barbie Movie.” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gender Studies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 23 (1): 81-92. doi: </span><a href="https://doaj.org/article/60743462dd3146d285462c56be489c97"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://doaj.org/article/60743462dd3146d285462c56be489c97</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article, published in Gender Studies, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">discusses bipolar interpretations of what the Barbie figure represents, one side being the reinforcement of patriarchy, capitalism, and unrealistic beauty standards, the other being independence and self-awareness. While the author argues for the latter position, she does not reject the presence of patriarchal consumerism in the society. However, with the context of the 2023 Barbie movie, she focuses on how, over time, the Barbie has evolved to present a broader feminist awakening, where ideas of hyperfemininity and unrealistic beauty myths are rejected, where independence, human imperfection, and self-identity are embraced. The author employs cultural and media analysis on the Barbie movie and feminist theoretical frameworks to support her argument. With such an argument, even though the source does not directly talk about my song, it discusses the theme of the movie and its implications about the society that deeply ties with the theme of Billie Eilish's Lyrics. This source helps me to contextualize more of what Billie Eilish is writing about.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hein, Ethan. 2024. “What makes an Oscar-winning song?

Besides this, in the opening, he discusses a live performance of the song from the Academy Awards ceremony and a remix version that the author likes the most, which is a drum ‘n’ bass version. For the live performance, the author notes how production and layering create a difference in the delivery of the song, including his thought on how the breathing was being removed in the recording while having it be obvious during the live performance. The remix shown is an example showing how this song has been changed, transformed, and how other people have responded to her song. With the addition of bass, drum, and a hint of electric music, it alters its original soft and quiet style, making it upbeat and dynamic. This source highlights how different elements and environments can alter the listening experience of this song, extending my understanding of the song/</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schube, Will. 2023. “Troye Sivan Covers Billie Eilish’s “What Was I Made For?” For BBC Radio 1”.

The author attaches a video for the audience and expresses his understanding. Troye Sivan’s  version of the song is consistent with Billie Eilish's overall minimalist style of having a simple background music and her emphasis on vocals. However, he includes more instruments, has more beats, and includes slight differences in the rhythm. This source provides insight on how other artists, especially ones from other genres and with other styles, perceive and present her work. This source presents how the same piece of music is being produced by another artist, presenting different vibes and atmosphere of the song. It helps me explore different messages and feelings this song can convey through different performances and use of elements.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/overview.html">Overview Page</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/introduction-2.html" class="al" target="_self">Introduction</a></li><li><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/critical-reading-2.html" class="al" target="_self">ASMR, Depression, and Resistance: Reading Billie Eilish with Jessica Holmes</a></li><li><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/music-review-2.html" class="al" target="_self">Searching for Purpose: Identity and Healing in Billie Eilish’s &quot;What Was I Made For?&quot;</a></li><li><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/playlist-2.html" class="al" target="_self">Through the Music: A Playlist for Finding Yourself</a></li><li><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/final-essay-2.html" class="al" target="_self">Quiet Resistance: Billie Eilish’s Minimalist Resistance in Pop Music</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/bibliography-2.html" class="al" target="_self">Bibliography</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://katelynnllu.github.io/music1701finalwwimf/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
